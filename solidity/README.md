   sometimes connections to your metamask will not be detected. This is a reown library problem. to resolve this issue,

- Click on your metamask
- Click on the green dot on the top-right beside your pharos menu

- Click on Metamask and go to settings
- Click on Advanced
- Click on Clear Activity Tab Data
